More on BlockingQueue:
------------------------------

Queues are common constructs in multithreaded applications. 
Clients add requests to a queue. A server retrieves requests from the queue. 
When no requests are available in the queue, the server waits for entries to be posted to it.


The Queue class, also new to Java 5, is a new collection class that supports the classic concept of a FIFO (first-in, first out) data structure. 
Other Java 5 queue implementations include support for removal based on priority, and a collection that acts like a stack.
